                <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California. His unwed biological
                    parents, Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, put him up for adoption. Steve was adopted by Paul
                    and
                    Clara Jobs, a lower-middle-class couple, who moved to the suburban city of Mountain View a couple of
                    years later.

                    The Santa Clara county, south of the Bay Area, became known as Silicon Valley in the early 1950s
                    after
                    the sprouting of myriads of semi-conductor companies in the area. As a result, young Steve Jobs grew
                    up
                    in a neighborhood filled with engineers working on electronics and other gizmos in their garages on
                    weekends. This shaped his interest in the field as he grew up. At age 13, he met one the most
                    important
                    persons in his life: 18-year-old Stephen Wozniak, an electronics whiz-kid —and an incorrigible
                    prankster, much like Steve himself.<br>
                    Five years later, when Steve Jobs reached college age, he told his parents he wanted to enroll in
                    Reed College — an expensive liberal arts college up in Oregon. Even though the tuition fees were
                    astronomical for the poor couple, they had promised their son's biological parents he would get a
                    college education, so they relented. Steve spent only one semester at Reed, then dropped out, as he
                    was more interested in eastern philosophy, fruitarian diets, and LSD than in the classes he took. He
                    moved to a hippie commune in Oregon where his main activity was cultivating apples.

                    A few months later, Steve returned to California to look for a job. He was hired at the young video
                    game maker Atari, and used his wages to make a trip to India with one of his college friends, Dan
                    Kottke, in order to 'seek enlightenment'. He came back a little disillusioned and started to take
                    more interest in his friend Woz's new activities.</p>
